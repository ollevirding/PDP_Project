# Parallell and Distributed Programming Project:
## Parallel implementation of the Conjugate Gradient method with stencil-based matrix-vector multiplication

This project was conducted in the course of Parallell and Distributed Programming at Uppsala University.

Owner: Olle Virding

The implementation relies on the framework Open MPI https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi
